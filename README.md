# Python_Basics_for_Data_Analysis
This repository is designed to share with you some exercises that I did to learn the basics of Python commands and syntax.

Small collection of exercises and notebooks focused on Python fundamentals for data analysis.

This folder contains a set of basic Python exercises designed to strengthen your programming fundamentals. Some of the topics we will cover include conditional statements (if, elif, else), integers, for and while loops, lists, and more. Each exercise is designed to help you understand core concepts through practical examples, making it easier to apply them in data analysis and other projects.
