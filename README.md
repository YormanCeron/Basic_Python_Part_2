# Basic Python Part 2

This repository is designed to share with you a series of exercises I created to continue building on the basics of Python, with a focus on control structures and more complex problem-solving.

It includes exercises and notebooks centered on loops (for and while), list manipulation, and other intermediate-level topics. 
This is part 2 of 2 repositories aimed at strengthening your programming fundamentals through practical, hands-on examples. 
The exercises in this section are slightly more challenging, encouraging you to combine concepts learned in previous exercises—such as conditionals, 
list operations, and the use of functions—while preparing you to tackle real-world data analysis tasks.
